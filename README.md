## Description

In this application I created a content management systems (CMS), without starter code, that will allow a user to view and manage a database of employees and their respective roles inside a company. My application is a command-line application that uses Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

My application is able to accept user input to determine if they want to; view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. Each of these options render various tables or inquire prompts that adds or updates the desired information in the database.

The following video shows an example of my application being used from the command line:
